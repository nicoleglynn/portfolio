				<p>I got bit by the design bug early and <span class="hl">built my first website 15 years ago</span> &mdash; at age 15, funny enough - to share my pixel art. Over the years I progressed from table-based layouts with spacer gifs to responsive, mobile-ready, css-powered designs. I got deep into <span class="hl">Wordpress</span> in the early days, getting comfortable with php syntax and a little bit of mySQL by building custom themes for personal sites and student portfolios.</p>

				<p>In 2009, I <span class="hl">got my BA in graphic design</span> and started freelancing under the name Marginalia Studios. I spent a few years doing web design and development work for local business and artists before switching to the world of corporate in-house design when I <span class="hl">joined Lycos</span> (yes, of 90's search fame) in 2012 as part of the team behind lycos.com, tripod.com, and angelfire.com.</p> 

				<p>After just over two years at Lycos, I moved on to <span class="hl">COMSOL</span>, where I joined a small, ambitious team responsible for comsol.com as well as the company's intranet, which is a mix of 3rd party software and lots and lots if in-house built tools for everything from content management, marketing and sales, and customer support.</p>			</div>

							<p>A small but important project - we were getting a relatively high number of reports of customers downloading a small utility called COMSOL Client when they meant to download the main software, so I redesigned and re-built the download pages to be more clear about what software was being downloaded, and how to find the right version and platform.</p>

							<p>In 2013, Lycos had a variety of internal customer service tools - some new, some almost a decade old. This project consisted of creating a single navigation and search bar to unify them, and giving the CSS a facelift to improve legibility until a larger project could be launched to re-build the entire system.</p>
							<p>The front-end facelift of existing tools posed a unique challenge in that - for various reasons involving the legacy backedn - I couldn't change the HTML, only the CSS.</p>

							<p>Tripod is a drag-and-drop website builder that works based on page templates having designated editable areas into which users can drop whatever (and however much) content they like. This flexibility was the primary challenge in designing templates for the system - they had to be well-structured, yet highly flexible.</p>
