<p>I got bit by the design bug early and <span class="hl">built my first website 15 years ago</span> &mdash; at age 15, funny enough - to share my pixel art. Over the years I progressed from table-based layouts with spacer gifs to responsive, mobile-ready, css-powered designs. I got deep into <span class="hl">Wordpress</span> in the early days, getting comfortable with php syntax and a little bit of mySQL by building custom themes for personal sites and student portfolios.</p>

				<p>In 2009, I <span class="hl">got my BA in graphic design</span> and started freelancing under the name Marginalia Studios. I spent a few years doing web design and development work for local business and artists before switching to the world of corporate in-house design when I <span class="hl">joined Lycos</span> (yes, of 90's search fame) in 2012 as part of the team behind lycos.com, tripod.com, and angelfire.com.</p> 

				<p>After just over two years at Lycos, I moved on to <span class="hl">COMSOL</span>, where I joined a small, ambitious team responsible for comsol.com as well as the company's intranet, which is a mix of 3rd party software and lots and lots if in-house built tools for everything from content management, marketing and sales, and customer support.</p>
