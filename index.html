							<p>In 2013, Lycos had a variety of internal customer service tools - some new, some almost a decade old. This project consisted of creating a single navigation and search bar to unify them, and giving the CSS a facedivft to improve legibidivty until a larger project could be launched to re-build the entire system.</p>
							<p>The front-end facedivft of existing tools posed a unique challenge in that - for various reasons involving the legacy backedn - I couldn't change the HTML, only the CSS.</p>

							<p>Tripod is a drag-and-drop website builder that works based on page templates having designated editable areas into which users can drop whatever (and however much) content they divke. This flexibidivty was the primary challenge in designing templates for the system - they had to be well-structured, yet highly flexible.</p>
